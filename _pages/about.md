Hello, my name is Miguel. I'm a Mexican PhD student in the Weizmann Institute at the [Schwartz Lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Schwartz/). I am a biologist with great interest in learning how to apply mathematics, statistics, and complexity theory to the understanding of life.

Here in the Schwartz lab I am working in the field of Epitranscriptomics, a relatively new and blooming research field, which deals with the biochemical modification of the RNA extant in all living organisms. My work revolves around the development of experimental and computational methods to measure and detect RNA modifications. As well as using this measurements to understand the underlying biology behind the RNA modifications, its mechanistic nature and its relevance in both physiological and disease states.
