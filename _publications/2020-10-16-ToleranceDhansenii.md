Abstract
==========
The function of catalases A and T from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCta1 and ScCtt1) is to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mitigate oxidative stress. Catalase orthologs are widely found in yeast, suggesting that scavenging H2O2 is crucial to avoid the oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the function of catalase orthologs has not yet been experimentally characterized in vivo. Here, we heterologously expressed Debaryomyces hansenii DhCTA1 and DhCTT1 genes, encoding ScCta1 and ScCtt1 orthologs, respectively, in a S. cerevisiae acatalasemic strain (cta1Δ ctt1Δ). We performed a physiological analysis evaluating growth, catalase activity, and H2O2 tolerance of the strains grown with glucose or ethanol as carbon source, as well as under NaCl stress. We found that both genes complement the catalase function in S. cerevisiae. Particularly, the strain harboring DhCTT1 showed improved growth when ethanol was used as carbon source both in the absence or presence of salt stress. This phenotype is attributed to the high catalase activity of DhCtt1 detected at the exponential growth phase, which prevents intracellular ROS accumulation and confers oxidative stress resistance.
