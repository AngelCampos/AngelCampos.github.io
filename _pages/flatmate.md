## Hello! Looking for flatmates!

I am leaving my apartment at the end of December. **One
of my current flatmates will stay and he is looking for two new
flatmates within the Weizmann Institute Student community**

The apartment consists of three rooms and is very spacious, it 
is located 6 minutes away from [Pinsker gate](https://goo.gl/maps/D7dxkSJ373yFixWW7).
It is also comfortably located on the first floor, so not many stairs to climb up every day ;)

- The address is: [HaRa'az Street 13, apartment 1](https://goo.gl/maps/MSEeAwBXmPQcwVJu5)

The apartment has:

- Three bedrooms. (One for each).
- Fully equipped kitchen, with microwave, oven, gas stove, fridge and more.
- Two and a half bathrooms (one with bathtub, next to the available rooms).
- Washing room, with automatic washing machine and dryer.
- Dining room/living room, with a big cozy sofa, dining table, and a big window 
that looks on to the street.

## How much?:

We have two rooms available, *one bigger than the other*:

- Room A: Two windows, A/C, closet, double size bed, mirror, desk and chair. (₪ 1865.75)
- Room B: One window, A/C, closet, bookcase, double size bed, small desk and chair. (₪ 1692.60)

* Rent includes arnona (City tax).
* Utilities (Internet, gas, electricity, and water) round about **~ ₪ 150-200** or less per month per person.
