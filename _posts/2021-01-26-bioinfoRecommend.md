**--ENTRY IN PROGRESS--**

This is a list of some resources I find useful to 
conduct data analysis in Life Sciences Research,
some of them more specific to the field of Genomics,
Transcriptomics, and RNA-seq derived methods. 

## Programming

### R

- [R programming by Roger D. Peng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). A 
nicely paced introductory course to R. After this course you will be able to use R
for many basic data analyisi tasks
	+ You can also find hiss ebooks at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming), (Beginner lvl.).
- [R for data science by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). 
An amazing guide on how to explore, manipulate, program, model, and communicate for Data Science, (Intermediate lvl.).

- [Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Liliana Florea](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools).
Great course to learn the most essential tools included in UNIX systems, unlocking a powerfull digital workbench.
- [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing). A great course into key concepts
of DNA sequence data analysis, which are useful as well for RNA-seq data analysis.
- [The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools#syllabus). 
A course that introduces to a set of tools for scientific work in data analyis,
centering in the programming language R, Rstudio, and Git's version control. I highly recommend this course, 
especially if you plan to use R as one of your main tools. Version control will make you more organized
and keep track of changes to all your code; and Rmarkdown will show you that communicable and reproducible 
scientific results are possible and should be painless.

## R packages

- Rsamtools
- GenomicAlignments
- [txtools](https://github.com/AngelCampos/txtools/). This is a package I 
developed to retrieve count data from alignment files (BAM) to perform
analysis that requires single-nucleotide resolution.

## Other tools I use a lot

### Bioinformatics

Just found this nice [Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://liulab-dfci.github.io/bioinfo-combio/). 
It is a collection of videos of lectures in bioinformatics and statistics for Harvard students.
The lecturers are from top institutes (Harvard, Broad, etc) And it seems very well structured.

### Unix

- Make: a minimal [tutorial](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) on make

## Ebooks

- [R packages by Hadley Wickham](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) A great practical reference 
to creating R packages using the R package devtools. It has been the main source of help to develop 
my R packages.

## Coursera guided projects?

- [Using probability distributions for real world problems in R](https://www.coursera.org/projects/probability-distributions-real-world-problems-r)
