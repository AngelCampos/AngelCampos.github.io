MAZTER-mine is a computational pipeline to analyze MAZTER-seq 
**([Garcia-Campos et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30676-2))**
derived data, a methodology that profiles m6A quantitatively across transcriptomes 
with a single-base resolution.

MAZTER-MINE is available at the Schwartz **[lab's github repository](https://github.com/SchwartzLab/mazter_mine)**

A **[tutorial](https://github.com/SchwartzLab/mazter_mine/tree/master/tutorial)** is also available, 
which shows processing of data from aligned reads (BAM files) to
final m6A quantifications.
