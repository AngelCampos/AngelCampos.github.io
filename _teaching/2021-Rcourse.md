The course is intended for graduate students in Life Sciences.
The goal of the course is to enable students to use the R programming 
language as a tool to extract biological insight from high throughput data.

We are intending to keep a record of this year's course in the form of a
companion [**e-Book.**](https://wis-rcourse.github.io/WIS_Rcourse_book/)

Topics covered range but are not limited to:

* Introduction to the R language, Rstudio IDE, and basic data structures.
* Control flow, conditionals and loops.
* Introduction to genomic data.
* Cluster analysis, and machine learning.
* Data visualization.

Course lectured by Igor Ultisky, Schraga Schwartz and Emmanuel Levy.
