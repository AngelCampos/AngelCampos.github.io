Hello, my name is Miguel. I'm a Mexican PhD student in the Weizmann Institute at the [Schwartz Lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Schwartz/). I am a biologist with great interest in learning how to apply mathematics, statistics, and complexity theory to the understanding of life.

Here in the Schwartz lab I am working in the field of Epitranscriptomics, a relatively new and blooming research field, which deals with the biochemical modification of the RNA extant in all living organisms, even viruses! My main work up to now, has revolved around the development of experimental and computational methods to measure and detect m6A, a very abundant RNA modification present in eukaryotes. As well as using this measurements to understand the underlying biology behind it, its mechanistic nature.
