**ENTRY IN PROGRES**

This is a list of some resources I find useful to 
conduct data analysis in Life Sciences Research,
some of them more specific to the field of Genomics,
Transcriptomics, and RNA-seq derived methods.

## Programming

- [R programming by Roger D. Peng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
	+ Also good ebooks at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/rdpeng)
- [Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Liliana Florea](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools)
- [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing)
- [The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools#syllabus)


## R packages

- Rsamtools
- GenomicAlignments
- txtools


## Other tools I use a lot

- STAR: RNA-seq reads aligner

## Ebooks

- [R packages by Hadley Wickham](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html)


## Coursera guided projects?

- [Using probability distributions for real world problems in R](https://www.coursera.org/projects/probability-distributions-real-world-problems-r)
