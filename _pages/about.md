Hello, my name is Miguel. I am a biologist with great interest in understanding 
life from a quantitative and systematic perspective. My current efforts are 
focused on advancing the understanding of RNA modifications, with a focus on 
the abundant mRNA modification N6-Methyladenosine (m6A). I am currently an 
academic collaborator at the [Schwartz Lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/Schwartz/) 
of the Weizmann Institute of Science, in which I recently graduated as a PhD 
and I am looking for a prospective lab to continue my work as a postdoctoral 
fellow.


In the Schwartz lab, we work in the field of Epitranscriptomics, a relatively 
new and booming research field that deals with the biochemical modifications 
of RNA molecules of all living organisms and even viruses. My current work 
revolves around the RNA modification [m6A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N6-Methyladenosine).
m6A is a highly abundant mRNA modification present in all eukaryotes, 
and it has recently received attention as a potential therapeutic target for 
treating diseases such as Cancer, Osteoporosis, Obesity, and Diabetes. 
At the SchwartzLab, we developed [a methodology](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30676-2), 
that is able to detect and quantify m6A in a high-throughput, single-nucleotide,
 and antibody-independent manner. Using this new technology we uncovered a code
that dictates m6A deposition across the transcriptomes of mouse and yeast, 
one of our main conclusions is that m6A deposition is strongly coded in the RNA
sequence of each gene.
