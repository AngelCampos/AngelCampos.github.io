Summary
========

* m6A-seq2 is a multiplexed immunoprecipitation-RNA-seq coupled method that 
measures m6A across the epitranscriptome reducing technical variability, cost,
and labor.
* m6A-seq2 allows for sample-level m6A relative quantitation, orthogonal to 
mass-spectrometry methods, as well as gene-level quantitations.
* m6A-seq2 m6A gene-level measurements explains roughly 30% of the variability
in RNA half life on mouse embryonic stem cells.

Abstract
=========

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification of messenger RNA 
in mammals. To interrogate its functions and dynamics, there is a critical
need to quantify m6A at three levels: site, gene and sample. Current approaches 
address these needs in a limited manner. Here we develop m6A-seq2, relying on 
multiplexed m6A-immunoprecipitation of barcoded and pooled samples. m6A-seq2 
allows a big increase in throughput while reducing technical variability, 
requirements of input material and cost. m6A-seq2 is furthermore uniquely 
capable of providing sample-level relative quantitations of m6A, serving as 
an orthogonal alternative to mass spectrometry-based approaches. Finally, 
we develop a computational approach for gene-level quantitation of m6A. We 
demonstrate that using this metric, roughly 30% of the variability in RNA 
half life in mouse embryonic stem cells can be explained, establishing m6A 
as a main driver of RNA stability. m6A-seq2 thus provides an experimental 
and analytic framework for dissecting m6A-mediated regulation at three 
different levels.
