## Hello we are looking for a flatmate!

We have a room available in our big and cozy apartment located 5 minutes
away from the Weizmann Institute. The room is available from June 1st onwards.

- Our adress is: [HaRa'az Street 13, apartment 1](https://goo.gl/maps/MSEeAwBXmPQcwVJu5)

The room has two windows and is big enough to fit confortably a double-size bed, a closet and something more
as you can see in the pictures. It is next to a full bathroom that is mostly used by the flatmate of this room.

The house has:

- Three bedrooms, one for each of us.
- Fully equipped kitchen, with microwave, oven, gas stove, fridge and more.
- Two and a half bathrooms (one with tub, one next to the room in rent).
- Washing room, with automatic washing mashine and dryer.
- Dining room/living room, with a big cozy sofa, dining table, and big window that looks on the street

It is also comfortably located in the first floor, so not many stairs to climb up ;)

## How much?:

- The share of the rent is **1640.65 ILS** (proportional to the size of bedrooms, includes Arnona).
- Utilities (Internet, gas, electricity, and water) round about **~200 ILS** or less per month per person.
