I just got my first PhD paper published, which includes the publication of my 
first software. So I thought it was time to make my own site to organize this and
future work.

[Deciphering the “m6A Code” via Antibody-Independent Quantitative Profiling](https://angelcampos.github.io/publication/2019-03-08_DecipherM6A_Cell)

I'm very happy to come to the conclusion of a project, but I hope it will become 
a starting point, for me and for many others.

As a personal space probably this will be the best place to express this 
(not sure , but I just want to write this down now. It's not like I won a Nobel 
Prize... yet, but I want to thank all the people that have been there for me, I 
really feel fortunate to be who I am, and for the journey that is my life. And I
know it couldn't be possible without all this wonderful people):

I want to thank all my advisors up to this point of my scientific career, I will always 
do. Claudia Segal, Enrique Hernández and now Schraga Schwartz. Each one of you has believed 
in me, taken me into your labs and nurtured my person. I will always be grateful for the 
lessons learned beneath your wings.

Special thanks to my family which are always supporting my journey and giving me 
motivation to keep doing what I love to do, even when is hard to do it, and so far away.
Rocio, my mom; Rosa, my grand mother, I miss you very much and I love you with 
all my heart, at the end I'm doing this for me, but I hope (and know) that you
find pride and joy in my own journey. Last but not least Gerardo, my best friend,
my Maecenas, my North, and now my husband; I know it's not been easy but in short 
we will be reunited at last, I love you <3.
